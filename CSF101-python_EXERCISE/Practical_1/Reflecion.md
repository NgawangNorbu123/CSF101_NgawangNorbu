# Reflection

# What I Learned
My practical work demonstrated how each programming concept connects and builds upon the last. I significantly improved my ability to write clean, readable code, successfully breaking down complex problems into smaller functions and gaining a solid understanding of program data flow. By the end, I was proficient enough to write complete, meaningful programs incorporating file operations, looping, and recursion.

# Challenges and Solutions
File Path Management: I struggled with files failing to open due to incorrect directory paths. I solved this by mastering the use of relative paths (like ./data/file.txt) and always verifying the program's current working directory.

Recursive Logic: Understanding recursion was initially difficult, often leading to infinite loops. I overcame this by diligently visualizing the step-by-step calls and using print statements to see exactly how the base and recursive cases work in tandem to control the function."
