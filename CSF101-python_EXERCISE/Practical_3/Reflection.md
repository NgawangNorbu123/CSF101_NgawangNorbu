# What You have apllied:

During this practical, I applied several skills:

-Python programming skills: Writing clean, modular, and reusable code.

-Problem-solving skills: Thinking logically to design algorithms.

-Debugging techniques: Identifying and fixing errors using test cases.

## What I Learn:

Through this practical i learned about implementing stacks and queues, below are the keys that i learned:
1. Fundamental Concepts
Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out):
Operations like push(), pop(), and peek().

Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out):
Operations like enqueue(), dequeue(), and peek().
3. Problem Solving Using Data Structures
-Implement Stack using Queue(s):
Learned how to simulate stack behavior using queue operations by rotating elements after each push.

### Challanges face how did you overcome?
Challenge:
Initially, I was confused about the differences between stack and queue operations, especially when deciding which end to insert and remove elements from.
Solution:
I revised the theory, practiced step-by-step examples, and wrote simple test cases to clearly visualize LIFO and FIFO behavior.

Challenge:
Simulating a stack using only queue operations was tricky because queues naturally follow FIFO, while stacks follow LIFO.
I struggled to maintain the correct order of elements after each push operation.

Solution:
I revised the theory, practiced step-by-step examples, and wrote simple test cases to clearly visualize LIFO and FIFO behavior.
