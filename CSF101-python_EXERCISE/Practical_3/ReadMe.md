## ** Singly Linked List Implementation including leetcode problems to Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists, Remove Nth Node From End of List:**
### **Note**
- This project uses **singly linked lists**, where each node points to the next node only.
- A **node** contains two things:
  1.'data' – the value stored in the node.
  2. 'next' – a pointer to the next node (or "None" if it is the last node).
- The linked list is different from a Python list ([]) because:
  - Elements are not stored in continuous memory.
  - Adding or removing elements is faster for large lists.
- This project includes **basic operations**:
  - Add (append)
  - Insert at a specific position
  - Delete
  - Search
  - Reverse
- It also includes **common problems from LeetCode**:
  - Reverse Linked List
  - Merge Two Sorted Lists
  - Remove Nth Node from End
- No extra libraries are needed; it uses **only standard Python**.
- Recommended to run this project in **VS Code** for easy testing and visualization.
